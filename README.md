# Rush Hour 2
The second iteration of Rush Hour.

## Wait, what?
Yeah, I'm going to try and find some time to rebuild Rush Hour without the horrible dependencies.

## Why?
The old Rush Hour was a bit of a mess and used a propriatary dll that I created to try make things easier to develop for, but it ended up worse in the end.

The aim for this version is to replace the current workshop build of Rush Hour with a revamped mod with better redirection code to handle other mods and future game updates better.

## Targets
Ideally, I'm going to split the mod up so the core Rush Hour functionality (day/night traffic, work hours, etc.) will be in the mod, but extra features (events, parking, etc.) will be split into other mods in order to reduce bloat and separate work into different areas.

## When
There's no real aim, as I don't know when I'm going to get time to work on the mod, but the target is *before or by the next Cities expansion*, but I can't make any promises.
